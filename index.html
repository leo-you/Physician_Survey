<p>The model coefficients are shown in the table and the interpretation of the coefficient is the odds, which is exp(coefficient) of the factor compared to the baseline factor, which in this case would be availability. If the odds is greater than 1, it means that respondents are more likely to choose to the right direction of the scale than availability.</p>
